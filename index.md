# Genomics
Our [genali](https://github.com/Genalico/genali) genome alignment pipeline
for RNA-Seq data has been released. Based on the 'GNU make' progam,
it processes data via a pipeline of dependency resolutions.
It is easily adptable to new computational environments and profits from
the simplicity and reliability of 'make'.
